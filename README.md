### Description:

Launch Sites Appended is a scenery pack for Kerbal Konstructs. Once installed it will either amend (if you have the Making History DLC) or add new launch sites to KSP.
The additions/Amendments are:

* **Kerman's Start** (Dessert Launch Site with Making History) - Modeled loosely on Gagarin's Start at Baikonur, adds several structures and a large flame trench to the site. Also adds runway numbers to either the Making History runway, or the runway added by this pack. (Soyuz launcher shown comes from Modular Launch Pads, which I highly recommend)
* **Woomerang** - Completely freelanced, but positioned at the coordinates used by Making History, this site is disjointed due to the terrain.
* **WayFinders** - Based on real world navigation aids of the US Air Mail in the early 20th century, this KK tracking station is a very visible pointer toward the runway at KSC. I use this as a guidance marker for my shuttle approaches - helping me to visually perceive where I am while in the rather featureless expanse between Mt. Keverest and KSC.
* **KSC2** - Once an Easter Egg and now, via Kerbal Konstructs, an additional launch site. My additions here excavate it from the terrain, and lend a look like the original in early versions of Kerbal Space Program. The addition of a platform upon the original launch pad also eliminates the odd physics phreakout that sometimes happened when spawning a rocket here. (There is still no runway)
* **Kerbal Memorial** - Where this project started. Upon loosing 2 Kerbals during a mission I was gutted and made a memorial to them. That grew from a pair of planted flags at the KSC Monolith into what you see now. Complete with a statue of a Kerbal riding a rocket arms akimbo and a granite sculpture of the original Mk1 Pod.

### Dependencies:

* [Kerbal Konstruts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204210-ksp-18-kerbal-konstructs-continued/)
* [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-18x-112x-module-manager-422-june-18th-2022-the-heatwave-edition/)
* [OSSNTR - Omega's Stockalike Structures: No Textures Required](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/169891-wip-omega482s-dev-thread-omegas-stockalike-structures-no-textures-required-alpha-now-available/)
* [Lack's KSC++](https://github.com/TedThompson/KSC-Plus-Plus-Continued-Reissued) (This will be patched to NOT affect KSC, only add their Statics - Patch can be removed if desired, see notes for details)
* [Tundra Space Center](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/174368-18-112-tundras-space-center-v20-december-18th-stockalike-ksc-launchpads/) (Not an actual Space Center, but a pack of great stockalike pads and models for KK)

### Notes:

* **Making History DLC** - this pack automagically detects if Making History is installed and makes the required alterations. If you have MH, it just adds the surrounding scenery. If you do not have MH, it also adds the launch pads and runways at Dessert Launch Site and Woomerang.
* **KSC++** - As shipped, this mod will disable the KSC++ instances, and only add Lack's static models for Kerbal Konstructs to use. If you desire to ALSO have KSC++ display at KSC, simply remove `..\GameData\FP_LaunchSitesAppended\Patches\KSC++_Instance_removal.cfg` and the KSC++ scenery will appear.
* **Static Duplication in the KK Static list** - If you dabble in placing scenery yourself, you may notice OSS items with the suffix "_g2" along with the original, these are clones made with Module Manager scripts which make a copy that uses the more advanced GrassColor2 module of Kerbal Konstructs for better texture matching with the terrain. I decided to make clones and update those in the off chance someone might download my pack who is already using the original version of the OSS structures, in order to not affect them in any way.
* **KSC Extended** - KSC Extended adds a ton of content to KSC, but none of it is near the monolith. It also adds a new launch center. None of LSA's work conflicts with this. At KSC the hex pictured above is all that happens at KSC and I have no content anywhere near the Tundra Complex added by KSC Extended.
